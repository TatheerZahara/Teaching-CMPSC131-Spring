# Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and prints it multiplicative table. For example, if you give 2 as a parameter, the output will look like: 

> 2*1=2

> 2*2=4

> 2*3=6

# Use the program that you had written in the previous question, and do the following: 
* Remove the parameters: Your name, number of courses, names of courses 
* Add the parameters: marks in courses (if you have three courses, youâ€™d have three parameters)
* Find the average marks and return the average to the main body. 
* Print the average outside the function
